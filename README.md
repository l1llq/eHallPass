  This project was done for the IB Computer Science SL IA, supporting iteration, conditionals, and software design to implement a deep documentational report.

  Currently a prototype of an improved "eHallPass" for highschool students in the Fairfax County area. 
  Where students and staff/teachers can use a digital hallpass system with higher results than previous applications.
  
  Advancements include: a "check all" button for staff, a more accessible temporary pass for students with a timer, cleaner layout, and
  improved bug fixes related to a high multitude of passes at once.
